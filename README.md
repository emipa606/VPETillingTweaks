An addon for the Vanilla Expanded Plants mod that tweaks tilling so it requires less micromanagement, but as a trade-off rich soil will be less effective without it.

- Adds an automatic tilling option to growing zones.
- Lowers the fertility of rich soil to 120%.
- Allows rich soil to be tilled, increasing fertility to 140%.
